\title{The Effect of Fatigue on Team and Player Performance in Basketball and Hockey}

\begin{document}

\maketitle{}

In goal-based team sports such as basketball, hockey, or soccer, it is commonly accepted that player fatigue plays an important role in a team’s ability to play both offense and defense.  Fatigue is difficult to measure with raw statistics, since players have differing endurance levels and game situations often dictate the pace of play.  We propose a latent variable model wherein net contribution to a team’s point margin is affected by a multiplicative factor for fatigue.  We consider several models for how time in play contributes to a latent fatigue factor, and several models for how fatigue is linked to performance.  We apply this approach to play-by-play data from both the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL) from the 2002--2013 seasons.  For the NBA, we estimate optimal time lengths for player substitution.  For the NHL, we estimate optimal shift lengths for individual players and suggest substitution strategies for coaches.
